YEAH I SUPPOSE I HAVE BEEN BUT IT'S GOING FROM ME
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO START
IT'S ALL MIXED UP WITH SO MANY OTHER THINGS YOU REMEMBER OVERSEAS I WAS IN COMMAND OF A COMPANY
WELL I LOST THEM
JUST ABOUT ALL
IT TAKES SOME TIME FOR A GUY TO TOSS THAT OFF 'CAUSE THEY WEREN'T JUST MEN
FOR INSTANCE ONE TIME IT HAD BEEN RAINING SEVERAL DAYS AND THIS KID CAME TO ME AND GAVE ME HIS LAST PAIR OF DRY SOCKS I PUT THEM IN POCKET IT'S ONLY A LITTLE THING BUT THAT'S THE KIND OF GUYS I HAD
THEY DIDN'T DIE THEY KILLED THEMSELVES FOR EACH OTHER I MEAN THAT EXACTLY A LITTLE MORE SELFISH AND THEY'D HAVE BEEN HERE TODAY
I GOT THIS IDEA WATCHING THEM GO DOWN EVERYTHING WAS BEING DESTROYED SEE BUT IT SEEMED THAT THERE WAS ONE NEW THING BEING MADE A SORT OF RESPONSIBILITY MAN FOR MAN
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN TO SHOW THAT TO BRING THAT ONTO THE EARTH AGAIN LIKE SOME KIND OF MONUMENT AND EVERYONE WOULD FEEL IT STANDING BEHIND HIM AND IT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO HIM
THEN I CAME BACK AND IT WAS INCREDIBLE THERE WAS NO MEANING IN IT HERE THE WHOLE THING TO THEM SEEMED LIKE SORT OF A BUS ACCIDENT I WENT TO WORK WITH DAD AND THAT RAT RACE AGAIN
AND I FELT WHAT YOU SAID ASHAMED SOMEHOW 'CAUSE NOBODY WAS CHANGED AT ALL IT SEEMED TO MAKE SUCKERS OUT OF A LOT OF GUYS I FELT WRONG TO BE ALIVE TO OPEN THE NEW BANK BOOK DRIVE THE NEW CAR SEE THE NEW REFRIGERATOR
I MEAN YOU CAN TAKE THOSE THINGS OUT OF A WAR BUT WHEN YOU DRIVE THAT CAR YOU'VE GOTTA KNOW THAT IT CAME OUT OF THE LOVE A MAN CAN HAVE FOR A MAN YOU'VE GOTTA BE A LITTLE BETTER BECAUSE OF IT
BECAUSE OTHERWISE ALL YOU HAVE IS REALLY LOOT AND THERE'S BLOOD ON IT AND I DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE ANY OF IT AND I GUESS THAT INCLUDED YOU

YOU REMEMBER OVERSEAS I WAS IN COMMAND OF A COMPANY
WELL I LOST THEM
JUST ABOUT ALL
IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME TO TOSS THAT OFF BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T JUST MEN
FOR INSTANCE ONE TIME IT HAD BEEN RAINING SEVERAL DAYS AND THIS KID CAME TO ME AND GAVE ME HIS LAST PAIR OF DRY SOCKS
I PUT THEM IN MY POCKET THAT'S ONLY A LITTLE THING BUT THESE ARE THE KIND OF GUYS I HAD
THEY DIDN'T DIE THEY KILLED THEMSELVES FOR EACH OTHER I MEAN THAT EXACTLY A LITTLE MORE SELFISH AND THEY'D HAVE BEEN HERE TODAY
AND I GOT THIS IDEA WATCHING THEM GO DOWN EVERYTHING WAS BEING DESTROYED SEE BUT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THERE WAS ONE NEW THING THAT WAS MADE
A SORT OF RESPONSIBILITY MAN FOR MAN YOU UNDERSTAND ME
AND THEN I CAME HOME AND IT WAS AMAZING
I FELT WHAT YOU SAID ASHAMED SOMEHOW
BECAUSE NOBODY WAS CHANGED AT ALL IT SEEMED TO MAKE SUCKERS OUT OF A LOT OF GUYS
I FELT WRONG TO BE ALIVE TO OPEN THE NEW BANK BOOK TO DRIVE THE NEW CAR TO SEE THE NEW REFRIGERATOR
WHEN YOU DRIVE THE NEW CAR YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT IT CAME OUT OF THE LOVE A MAN CAN HAVE FOR A MAN YOU'VE GOT TO BE A LITTLE BETTER BECAUSE OF THAT
OTHERWISE WHAT YOU HAVE IS REALLY JUST LOOT AND THERE'S BLOOD ON IT I DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE ANY OF IT
I GUESS THAT INCLUDED YOU
ANNIE ANNIE I'M GOING TO MAKE A FORTUNE FOR YOU
FINE
IT'S AFTER ELEVEN LET'S GO HOME
THERE IS NO POINT IN COMING DOWN HERE
I JUST DON'T IT'S STUPID
PASS UP WHAT THESE LITTLE FISH SWIM ONTO THE BEACH FLOP AROUND AND THEN SWIM AWAY AND THEN THEY DIE
WHAT ARE YOU SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS ISN'T A MOON LANDING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT'S FISH IT'S FISH NOBODY EVEN EATS

ARE YOU COLD DO YOU WANT MY JACKET WE SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT THE BLANKET OUR BLANKET
AH THIS IS GREAT ISN'T IT I DIDN'T EVEN THINK TO BRING A SIX PACK A SIX PACK WOULD BE JUST THE TICKET RIGHT ABOUT NOW
THAT'S MY POINT TOO
THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN KANSAS THEY'D HAVE TO GET PLANE TICKETS AND HOTEL RESERVATIONS TO COME SEE THIS WE'RE JUST FORTY MINUTES AWAY IT'S TOO GOOD TO PASS UP
THIS IS THE BIG NIGHT FOR THESE GUYS LIFE'S LAST ORGY
LIKE THE SWALLOWS RETURNING TO CAPISTRANO OR THE LEMMINGS THROWING THEMSELVES OFF THE CLIFFS LIKE THAT THERE'S MYSTERY HERE AND MAGIC
WE JUST WEREN'T IN A GOOD SPOT THIS IS A MUCH BETTER SPOT
I'VE GOT GOOD INSTINCTS FOR THESE THINGS LOOK THERE WHAT'S THAT IS THAT IS THAT IS THAT NO IT'S JUST SEAWEED ISN'T IT
AH MAN THIS IS GREAT I WOULDN'T MISS THIS FOR ANYTHING I MEAN THINK ABOUT THIS I KNOW YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED BUT JUST THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A MINUTE
OUT THERE SOMEPLACE THERE'S THIS HUGE MASS OF SILVER FISH HEADING THIS WAY THEY DON'T KNOW WHY WE DON'T KNOW WHY IT WASN'T A DECISION THEY DIDN'T TAKE A VOTE
NO ONE SENT THEM A MAP OR AN INVITATION JUST SOME LITTLE INSTINCTUAL TIME RELEASE FIRECRACKER WENT OFF IN THEIR LITTLE BODIES AND ALL AS ONE THEY TURNED AND FORMED A LINE AS LONG AS THE CALIFORNIA COAST AND STARTED SWIMMING
THEY'RE SWIMMING RIGHT NOW AS IF THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS
IT'S SINGLE MINDEDNESS WITH NO MIND URGENCY THAT'S PURE URGE
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT DRIVES THEM THEY DON'T GIVE IT A NAME OR ASK QUESTION THEY JUST TURN AS ONE AND START THE SWIM THAT BRINGS THEM HERE TO THIS PLACE
WHERE WE STAND FOR MASSIVE CELEBRATION OF SEX AND DEATH
AH I'M GIVING MYSELF GOOSE BUMPS ALL MY HAIRS ARE POPPING UP
IT'S PR SOMEBODY SOLD YOU A BILL OF GOODS THAT THIS WONDERFUL EVENT IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE ON THE BEACH
GODDAMN IT AUGIE DON'T ASK ME THAT YOU ALWAYS ASK ME THAT I HATE IT WHEN YOU ASK ME THAT IT'S INSULTING
WE JUST HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT WHAT THIS EVENING IS SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE THIS IS NOT ABOUT FISH
WE TOTALLY SKIPPED RIGHT
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE GROW UP WE ARE NOT GOING TO SEE THE GRUNIONS
WE NEVER DO DO WE HAVE WE EVER
TWICE IS EVERY TIME WE'VE TRIED THAT'S EVER
AND THE FISH WON'T SHOW UP
WE THOUGHT I WAS PREGNANT AND WE HAD A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE BUT NO GLASSES YOU ASKED ME TO DANCE SO WE TOOK OFF OUR SHOES
AND YOU POPPED THE CORK AND WHILE WE WERE DANCING YOU SAID THE SOFTEST MOST INTIMATE THINGS TO ME
RIGHT INTO MY EAR SO THAT I COULD HEAR THEM AS MUCH AS SO THAT I COULD FEEL THEM AS MUCH AS HEAR THEM
AND I REMEMBER THINKING THIS IS IT AT LAST AT LAST I'M AS HAPPY AS I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
DANCING BAREFOOT IN THE SAND DRINKING CHAMPAGNE FROM THE BOTTLE
I WOULD RATHER NOT REMEMBER SOME THINGS I WOULD RATHER NOT HOPE FOR SOME THINGS
NO

THIS WHAT WHAT IS THIS THIS ISN'T EVEN ANYTHING
OH RIGHT SURE THIS IS STANDING ON THE BEACH THIS IS WAITING THIS IS FIGHTING
I KNOW YOU ARE AUGIE REALLY I DO I KNOW YOU WANTED THIS TO BE SPECIAL AND NICE AND IT'S THE FULL MOON AND THE SAND AND ALL BUT I JUST COULDN'T HELP THINKING ABOUT BEING SOMEWHERE ELSE
SOMEBODY WHO KNEW HOW TO ENJOY HERSELF AND DIDN'T TAKE EVERYTHING SO HARD

I MEAN THINK ABOUT PEOPLE IN KANSAS THEY'VE GOT TO GET LIKE YOU KNOW PLANE TICKETS AND HOTEL RESERVATIONS JUST TO SEE THIS WE'RE JUST FORTY MINUTES AWAY IT'S JUST TOO GOOD OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO PASS UP
YEAH BUT ALL THAT TIME ON THE BEACH IS THE HIGHLIGHT OF THEIR LITTLE LIVES YOU KNOW
AND ALL THAT ABOUT FLOPPING AROUND IT'S LIKE LAYING EGGS OR WHAT DO YOU SPAWNING OR MATING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
I MEAN THIS IS A BIG NIGHT FOR THESE GUYS YOU KNOW LIFE'S LAST ORGY
ALL RIGHT BUT THEY ARE FISH THAT DO SOMETHING NO OTHER FISH DO LIKE THE SWALLOWS WERE TURNING INTO CAPISTRANO OR LEMMINGS JUMPING OFF THE CLIFFS YOU KNOW LIKE THAT THERE'S THERE'S MAGIC HERE AND MYSTERY AND A LITTLE BIT OF THE UNEXPLAINABLE YOU KNOW I CAN'T SEE HOW YOU COULD NOT BE INTERESTED
LOOK THERE WHAT IS THAT IS THAT OH NO THAT'S SEAWEED
OH THIS IS GREAT I WOULDN'T MISS THIS FOR THE WORLD I MEAN THINK ABOUT THIS I KNOW YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED BUT JUST THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A SECOND
SOMEWHERE OUT THERE IS A GIANT MASS OF SILVER FISH ALL SWIMMING IN THIS DIRECTION THEY DON'T KNOW WHY THEY'RE DOING IT WE DON'T KNOW WHY THEY'RE DOING IT THEY DIDN'T IT WASN'T A DECISION NO ONE TOOK A VOTE NOBODY SENT THEM AN INVITATION OR A MAP OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IT WAS JUST SOME INTERNAL TIME RELEASE FIRE CRACKER THAT WENT OFF AND ALL AS ONE THEY TURNED AROUND AND FORMED THIS GIANT LINE AS LONG AS THE CALIFORNIA COASTLINE AND THEY JUST STARTED SWIMMING THEY ARE SWIMMING RIGHT NOW AT THIS VERY MOMENT AND AND
AND IT'S SINGLE MINDEDNESS WITH NO MIND IT IT'S URGENCY IT'S PURE URGE I MEAN THEY DIDN'T MAKE ANY DECISIONS THEY DON'T ASK ANY QUESTIONS THEY DON'T GIVE IT A NAME

I DID WANT TO SEE IT I ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IT I JUST I KEEP THINKING THIS WILL BE THE TIME AND IT NEVER IS
DO YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME THAT WE CAME TO SEE THE GRUNION IT WAS ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO RIGHT AFTER WE GOT MARRIED WE THOUGHT I WAS PREGNANT WE HAD A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE AND NO GLASSES YOU ASKED ME TO DANCE WE TOOK OFF OUR SHOES AND WHILE WE WERE DANCING YOU SAID THE MOST INTIMATE THINGS TO ME RIGHT IN MY EAR SO I COULD FEEL THEM AS MUCH AS HEAR THEM
AND I REMEMBER THINKING TO MYSELF FINALLY I AM AS HAPPY AS I AM SUPPOSED TO BE
DANCING BAREFOOT IN THE SAND DRINKING CHAMPAGNE OUT OF THE BOTTLE
I WOULD RATHER NOT REMEMBER SOME THINGS I'D RATHER NOT HOPE FOR SOMETHING
